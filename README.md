## Overview üìñ
AzKube is a PowerShell module designed to simplify the management and automation of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. It provides a set of cmdlets that streamline your AKS workflow by listing resource group details for and allowing management of AKS clusters including easy batch setup and testing of local `kubectl` connections, getting cluster resource IDs, `az resource update`-ing clusters.

## Features ‚ú®
- Manage AKS clusters
  - List AKS clusters, their resource group and their subscription ID
  - Set up AKS connections for `kubectl` and `kubectl`-based tools (like OpenLens, Lens, k9s, etc.)
  - Test AKS connections for `kubectl` et al
  - Get resource IDs for AKS clusters
  - Run `az resource update` on AKS clusters to restart AKS Planned Maintenance (Cluster Upgrades, Node Image Upgrades, Weekly Updates)
- Set up AKS connections standalone command
    - Set up AKS connections for `kubectl` and `kubectl`-based tools (like OpenLens, Lens, k9s, etc.)
    - Test AKS connections for `kubectl` et al

```
- `-ProxyUrl` [Default: '']: Proxy URL to be used for all AKS clusters. Will be saved to AzKubeProxyUrl user environment variable for default value.
- `-SkipProxyAll` [Default: $false]: Skip setting proxy on any AKS cluster.
- `-SkipTestConnections` [Default: $false]: Skip testing connections to the AKS clusters.
- `-SetupAllWithDefaults` [Default: $false]: Simple mode to get kubectl credentials for all AKS clusters found on all subscriptions in logged in tenant without asking for user input using default proxy.
- `-SelectAll` [Default: $false]: Initially select all AKS clusters for taking the action selected in the menu.
- `-SkipTestActions` [Default: $false]: Skip testing connections to the AKS clusters.
